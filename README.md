*!IMPORTANT!*  
Roles in discord appear like waterfall. Server owner is located on top of this waterfall.  
Because of this bot cant change server owner's nickname. To solve this bot uses his own id instead of server owner's.  
For bot to work correctly you must locate bot's role on the top of the rest roles waterfall
